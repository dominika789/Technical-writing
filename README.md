I've been working as a technical writer for over four years - user guides, installation and implementation manuals, how-to arcitles, FAQ articles, changelogs, video tutorials, diagrams. 
Check out my Wiki! There you will find sample technical documents that I have created, and sample style guide that could be used in the IT company :)
